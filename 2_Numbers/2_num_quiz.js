// . Answer the following questions. Also, explain why do you think that your answer is
// correct.
// 1. console.log(0 / 0)
// 2. console.log(0 / 5)
// 3. console.log(3 * 'a')
// 4. console.log('a' * 3)
// 5. console.log('b' + 4)
// 6. console.log(4 + 'b')
// 7. console.log(5 - 'c')
// 8. console.log('c' - 5)

console.log(0/0);
// ans is NaN. 0 is a natural number, not that it is or it isnt a number.Finally, the 0/0=0 argument is considered non-standard. That most mathematicians define 0/0=NaN is not the same as 0=NaN because these are competing definitions.So, in short, people often claim "zero is not a number" because they lack the background to understand the formal, rigorous definitions of the number system.

console.log(0/5);
// ans is 0. No matter what number except for 0 is going divide with give you a zero.

console.log(3*'a');
// ans is NaN. 3 is being muliple with a string.

console.log('a' * 3);
// it would be the same answer.

console.log('b' + 4);
// answer is b4. if any number is going to add with a string it will turn the number into string.

console.log(4 + 'b');
// answer is b4. the answer gonna be the same. but you need to learn about order of operations. + - have the same precedence and are associated to the left.

console.log(5 - 'c');
// answer should be NaN. since it is not a number you cant substract string from it. + is also a sign for string concatenation.

console.log('c' - 5);
// answer should be the same.
